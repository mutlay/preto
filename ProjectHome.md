## PRETO: A High-performance Text Mining Tool for Preprocessing Turkish Texts ##
Text documents are usually unstructured and written in natural language. To apply
conventional data mining techniques on text documents, a preprocessing operation is indispensable. Here, we introduce PRETO, a cross-platform, powerful and scalable preprocessing tool developed specifically for preprocessing Turkish texts, with a wide range of preprocessing options like stemming, stopword filtering, statistical term filtering, and n-gram generation.
